How would you like your life in its entirety to be described in your obituary? How about your roles in your professional career? How about your roles in your marriage and your family? How about your social relationships with your friends? Have you ever truly framed how you would want to be remembered? Do you have a mental picture there that can help guide what actions to take on present days? 

This is about destinations and directions. One can be proactive all she has wanted, but it may be prudent to ensure that the wall against which the ladder leans is what shes desires. Often times we are blindly motivated by significance of progresses, ignoring the apparent deviation from our set courses. To be an effective person, we need to ensure that our ends and our current positions are aligned. 

In business, the dichotomy of management and leadership demonstrates this relationship. A manager can be excellent in breaking down sophisticated business metrics and see through its completion, but a leader steers to understand if the metrics make sense towards some objective. To have an effective business, we need those who can transition from a managerial role into a leadership position, albeit deprived of the excitement of daily accomplishments, for the longevity of success.

An analogy can be drawn towards parenting: there is the choice of being remembered as a parent who has provided guidance and offered room for their offsprings to grow up, or, as someone who enforces their image of a perfect child, conditional on their life experiences, to others. It is important that behave in a way consistent of how we want to be remembered when we die. 

To begin with the end in mind, it is helpful to materialize the end and develop a personal mission statement. It focuses on what you would like to be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements). Such a statement is not about techniques and should not take the form of to-do list. It should cover attitudes and principles, one that offers constitutional guidance to one inner self. Everything around is guaranteed to change, but this document does not and anchor our lives. 

This statement focuses on the basic needs of our lives: security, which describes our senses of worth, identity, emotional anchorage, and self-esteem, guidance, which serves as the source of directions, wisdom, which is our perspective on life that manifests as judgment, discernment, and comprehension, and finally, power, which is the faculty or capacity to act. 

We paradigmatically fulfill these needs by centering our lives on some combination of the following entities: spouse, family, money, work, possession, pleasure, friendship, church, and self. They offer senses of fulfillment but not without a fatal flaw: their changes inevitably disorientate us, and we surrender to some external factors to control our lives, should we center on them. The principles, however, on which should we choose to focus on, offer true and changeless anchorage.

A personal mission statement elevates from the centers of our lives, and enumerates principles that can manifest as actionable items in those areas, for us the follow through. The best way to develop them is to use our imagination, creativity, conscience, and inspiration, to visualize affirmatively the vivid scenery in those areas. And then, write them down by roles. A mission statement can also be expanded to a family, an organization, or beyond, as the outcome of our collective thinking. They grant us peace because we know that we have the ends agreed upon and will relentlessly move towards it.
