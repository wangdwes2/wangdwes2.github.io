## Principles of Creative Cooperation

To increase the production capacity is to renew on the four dimensions: 1) *physical*, through exercise, nutrition, and stress management, 2) *spiritual*, through value clarification, commitment, study and meditation, 3) *mental*, through reading, visualizing, planning and writing, 4) *social/emotional*, through service, empathy, synergy and intrinsic security. Taking the time to sharpen the saw is a definitive Quadrant II activity and the most powerful investment in our lives, on ourselves. 

The *physical* dimension requires us to eat, rest, and exercise well, to build our body in three areas: endurance, flexibility and strength. The *spiritual* dimension requires us to constantly draw inspirations from our characters, values and commitments. The *mental* dimension requires us educate ourselves habitually through serious reading and writing, explorations of new subjects, and thinking critically. The *social/emotional* dimension requires us to develop interdependency through a solid characteristic integrity and an empathetic attitude, potentially via societal services.  

The self-renewal process should be balanced for individuals and for organizations. Moreover these dimensions are also synergistic among themselves: being more proactive (Habit 1) promotes personal leadership (Habit 2) and priority management (Habit 3); the more effective one person becomes in their private lives, the more likely they can develop a synergistic (Habit 6) Win-Win mindset (Habit 4) via emphatical communications (Habit 5). Renewal (Habit 7) applies to all, and lays down a self-developmental trajectory that resembles an upward spiral axed by conscience.
