## Principles of Creative Cooperation

*Synergy* is the highest activity in all life. Most people have not experienced even a moderate degree of synergy because of the perceived mental unpredictability and insecurity, but such are the natures of any creative endeavors that offer incredible interpersonal insights, learnings, and growth; with enormous personal security, openness, and a spirit of adventure, they serve as consistent sources of inspirations.
	
*Synergy* can be found in classrooms - powerful personal experiences become fertile soil for synergistic conversations, where established syllabi can be abandoned for a book to be written that includes the consensual learnings and insights, with alumni meetings taking place in years to come; synergy can be found in business, where communication initialized with respect, care and predictability can transform into creative synergistic conversations where people become courageous and empathic, indulged into an pleasant atmosphere of psychological air.   

*Synergy* is achieved via communication. The lowest level of communication comes out of low-trust situations, characterized by defensiveness, protectiveness and often legalistic languages, where an outcome of Win-Lose or Lose-Win may be sought after. The middle position is respectful communication: ugly confrontation is avoided, and politeness is paramount instead of empathy. The third alternative is synergistic where a Win-Win outcome is preferred. 

*Synergy* is the highest form of relationship, a major paradigmatic shift away from the dichotomous mentality. This relationship needs to exist in an interpersonal reality, but highly dependent individuals can be trapped in negative synergy where much time is spent in confessing other people’s sins. Insecure people believe that all reality should be amenable to their paradigms, without realizing that the exact strength of the relationship is to be different. To develop synergistic relationship, one must have access to both the intuitive, creative, and visual right brain, and the analytical, logical and verbal left brain, with sufficiency of internal security embodied in the principles of the first three habits.

Valuing the mental, emotional, and psychological differences between people is the essence of synergy. A person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize their own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interactions with others. Two persons can both be right, psychologically, despite any apparent logical reasons. 

In a Force Field Analysis, any level of performance is considered as a state of equilibrium between the driving forces and the restraining forces. In an interpersonal relationship, the driving forces are generally positive, reasonable, logical, conscious, and economic, whereas the restraining forces are often negative, emotional, illogical, unconscious, and socio-psychological. The inspiration here is that while we should introduce synergy to prioritize removal of those restraining forces, before increasing the driving forces. Most parties would agree to a Win-Win outcome regardless of their possibly deteriorated interpersonal facts - we only need to provide a mediating force towards synergy.

Ecology is the synergism in the Nature, and all nature is synergistic. The more genuine the involvement, the more sincere and sustained the participation in analyzing and solving problems, the greater the release of everyone’s creativity, and of their commitment to what they create.
